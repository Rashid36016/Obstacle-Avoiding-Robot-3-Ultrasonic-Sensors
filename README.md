# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot-3-Ultrasonic-Sensors
An Arduino robot that avoids obstacles using three HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors (Left, Center, Right) and four DC motors driven by the Adafruit Motor Shield (AFMotor library). The sketch uses a simple state machine to stop → back up → choose the freer side → pivot → and resume forward motion.
